WowSlider integrates the static html wowslider technology, using the 
wowslider generator to build the code template and further integrating dynamically
the distinct effects and skins several generations can provide.

things are not truely satisfactory at the moment :

1. Fullscreen rendering is not working nicely

2. Thumbnails need to be produced separately. there should be some convenient
way to produce automatically using GD or ImageMagic (what natively available in moodle
core for it) adequate thumbs using slide images

3. Behaviour must be checked on mobiles and tablet, with potential side adjustement.

4. slides can handle video. this needs to be checked and verifying the size control of slideshare
is working.

5. dimension control is not fully accurate.

6. Backup/restore should be properly handled and tested

7. Some completion rules should be added to match : 
- The slide show has been seen (whatever slide)
- All slides have been viewed

8. M27 version should be build, rebuilding logging code with events
